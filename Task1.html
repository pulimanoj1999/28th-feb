    <p>The Taj Mahal (/ˌtɑːdʒ məˈhɑːl, ˌtɑːʒ-/; lit. 'Crown of the Palace')[4][5][6] is an ivory-white marble mausoleum on the 
    right bank of the river Yamuna in the Indian city of Agra. It was commissioned in 1631 by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan 
    (r. 1628–1658) to house the tomb of his favourite wife, Mumtaz Mahal; it also houses the tomb of Shah Jahan himself. 
    The tomb is the centrepiece of a 17-hectare (42-acre) complex, which includes a mosque and a guest house, and is set in formal 
    gardens bounded on three sides by a crenellated wall.</p>
    <p>Construction of the mausoleum was essentially completed in 1643, but work continued on other phases of the project for another 10 years. 
     The Taj Mahal complex is believed to have been completed in its entirety in 1653 at a cost estimated at the time to be around ₹32 million, 
     which in 2020 would be approximately ₹70 billion (about US $1 billion). The construction project employed some 20,000 artisans under the guidance 
     of a board of architects led by Ustad Ahmad Lahauri, the emperor’s court architect. Various types of symbolism have been employed in the Taj to reflect 
     natural beauty and divinity.</p>

    <p>Mysore Palace, also known as Amba Vilas Palace, is a historical palace and a royal residence (house). 
        It is located in Mysore, Karnataka. It used to be the official residence of the Wadiyar dynasty and the seat of the Kingdom of Mysore. The palace is in the centre of Mysore, and faces the Chamundi Hills eastward. Mysore is commonly described as the 'City of Palaces', and there are seven palaces including this one. However, 
        the Mysore Palace refers specifically to the one within the new fort.</p>
    <p>The land on which the palace now stands was originally known as mysuru (literally, "citadel"). Yaduraya built the first palace inside the Old Fort in the 14th century, which was set ablaze and reconstructed multiple times. The Old Fort was built of wood and thus easily caught fire, while the current fort was built of stone, 
        bricks and wood. The current structure was constructed between 1897 and 1912, after the Old Palace burnt down, the current structure is also known as the New Fort. Mysore Palace is one of the most famous tourist attractions in India, after the Taj Mahal, with more than six million annual visitors.[1]</p>

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Varanasi">Click here</a>
    <p>Varanasi (Vārāṇasī, pronounced [ʋaːˈraːɳəsi]), also known by its former names of Banaras or Benares (Banāras, pronounced [bəˈnaːrəs] (listen))[10][11] and Kashi,[12][13][a] is a city on the left bank of the Ganges river in southeastern Uttar Pradesh state of northern India, located 692 kilometres (430 mi) southeast of India's 
        capital New Delhi and 320 kilometres (200 mi) east of the state capital Lucknow.</p>
    <p>It is the holiest city in Hinduism,[15][b] as well as having a syncretic tradition of Muslim artisanship that underpins its religious tourism.[18] The city also lies 121 kilometres (75 mi) downstream of Allahabad (officially Prayagraj), where the confluence with the Yamuna river is another Hindu holy city.</p>
    <h4>3.Red Fort</h4>

    <p>The Red Fort or Lal Qila (Hindustani: [laːlqiːlaː]) is a historic fort in Old Delhi, Delhi in India that served as the main residence of the Mughal Emperors. Emperor Shah Jahan commissioned construction of the Red Fort on 12 May 1638, when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi. Originally red and white, its design 
        is credited to architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori, who also constructed the Taj Mahal. The fort represents the peak in Mughal architecture under Shah Jahan and combines Persianate palace architecture with Indian traditions.</p>
    <p>The fort was plundered of its artwork and jewels during Nader Shah's invasion of the Mughal Empire in 1739. Most of the fort's marble structures were subsequently demolished by the British following the Indian Rebellion of 1857. The fort's defensive walls were largely undamaged, and the fortress was subsequently used as a garrison.</p>
    <h4>4.Gate Way</h4>

    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gateway_of_India">Click here</a>
    <p>The foundation stone was laid in March 1913 for a monument built in the Indo-Islamic style, inspired by elements of 16th-century Gujarati architecture. The final design of the monument by architect George Wittet was sanctioned only in 1914, and construction was completed in 1924. The structure is a memorial arch made of basalt, which is 26 metres 
        (85 feet) high, with an architectural resemblance to a triumphial arch as well as Gujarati architecture of the time.</p>
    <p>After its construction, the Gateway was used as a symbolic ceremonial entrance to India for important colonial personnel. The Gateway is also the monument from where the last British troops left India in 1948, following Indian independence. It is located on the waterfront at an angle, opposite the Taj Mahal Palace and Tower Hotel and overlooks the Arabian Sea. 
        Today, the monument is synonymous with the city of Mumbai, and is amongst its prime tourist attractions. The gateway is also a gathering spot for locals, street vendors, and photographers soliciting services. It holds significance for the local Jewish community as it has been the spot for Hanukkah celebrations, with the lighting of the menorah, since 2003. 
        There are five jetties located at the Gateway, of which two are used for commercial ferry operations.</p>

    <p>Amer Fort or Amber Fort is a fort located in Amer, Rajasthan, India. Amer is a town with an area of 4 square kilometres (1.5 sq mi)[2] located 11 kilometres (6.8 mi) from Jaipur, the capital of Rajasthan. Amber city and Amber fort were founded by ruler Alan Singh Chanda of Chanda dynasty of Meenas.[3][4] Located high on a hill, it is the principal tourist attraction in Jaipur.
        [5][6] Amer Fort is known for its artistic style elements. With its large ramparts and series of gates and cobbled paths, the fort overlooks Maota Lake,[6][7][8][9] which is the main source of water for the Amer Palace.</p>
    <p>Amer Palace is great example of Rajput architecture. Some of its buildings and work have influence of Mughal architecture.[10][11][12] Constructed of red sandstone and marble, the attractive, opulent palace is laid out on four levels, each with a courtyard. It consists of the Diwan-e-Aam, or "Hall of Public Audience", the Diwan-e-Khas, or "Hall of Private Audience", the Sheesh Mahal (mirror palace), 
        or Jai Mandir, and the Sukh Niwas where a cool climate is artificially created by winds that blow over a water cascade within the palace. Hence, the Amer Fort is also popularly known as the Amer Palace.[7] The palace was the residence of the Rajput Maharajas and their families. At the entrance to the palace near the fort's Ganesh Gate, there is a temple dedicated to Shila Devi, a Goddess of the Chaitanya cult, 
        which was given to Raja Man Singh when he defeated the Raja of Jessore, Bengal in 1604. (Jessore is now in Bangladesh).[6][13][14] Raja Man Singh had 12 queens so he made 12 rooms, one for each Queen. Each room had a staircase connected to the King’s room but the Queens were not to go upstairs. Raja Jai Singh had only one queen so he built one room equal to three old queen’s rooms.</p>
